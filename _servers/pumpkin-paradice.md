Pumpkin Paradise is a game created by @Sponix and programmed by @flines - coffee. It's a game about pumpkins that live in a paradise. Just kidding. This is just a virtual world but with something you never saw before in a game... Pumpkins! This is a game inspired by Box Critters, Club Penguin, Toonkins and much more. A MMORPG that soon will have quests, little home for the pumpkins, more rooms and etc! After everything I said to you, why don't you check it out?
